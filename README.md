### Hi There! ✋

I’m a Product Security Engineer at Toyota, specializing in security testing across multiple domains, including:

- Mobile Application Security
- API Security
- Cloud Security

I have a passion for continuous learning and constantly seek to expand my knowledge.

Right mow, I'm spending a lot of time learning **Rust**. It's pretty cool.
