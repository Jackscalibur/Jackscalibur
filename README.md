### Hi There! ✋

I’m a Product Security Engineer at Toyota, specializing in security testing across multiple domains, including Mobile, API, and Cloud security.

I have a passion for continuous learning and constantly seek to expand my knowledge.

Right mow, I'm spending a lot of time learning **Rust**. It's pretty cool.
