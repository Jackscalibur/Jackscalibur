# About Me

My name is Jackson, and I work for Toyota as a **Product Security Engineer**. I work to secure both vehicle and mobile application-facing services and APIs.

I have experience performing security testing for both Android and iOS applications, API security, cloud security, etc.

---

Hollistically, I'm interested in the intersection between cyber security and software engineering—that is, I enjoy both writing and securing software.

I enjoy using Python and Rust the most, but I am also comfortable with languages such as Golang and Java. I enjoy learning more about Network and Linux security in my spare time.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Rust, Golang, Python, Java
- Tools: Wireshark, Postman, Burp Suite, Ghidra
- Technologies: AWS: API Gateway, Lambda, S3, ECS, EKS, WAF, CloudFront
