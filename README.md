## About Me
I am a product security engineer for Toyota who performs security assessments against the Toyota and Lexus mobile applications, all vehicle-related APIs and vehicle-related AWS environments.

I also assist with certain component-level security testing, such as testing things like OS hardening techniques for vehicle infotainment units and data communication modules.
