# About Me

My name is Jackson, and I work for Toyota as a **Product Security Engineer**. What that means is, I work to secure the vehicle ecosystem—systems that interact with the vehicle and Toyota's mobile application.

My primary job responsibilities include performing API security testing on the mobile app, certain cloud infrastructure (if it pertains to vehicle-related services), and also [ECU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit)-specific testing, usually at the OS level ([AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/)).

Hollistically, I'm interested in the intersection between cyber security and software engineering—that is, I enjoy both writing and securing software.

Right now, I'm spending a lot of time learning **Rust**. It's pretty cool.
