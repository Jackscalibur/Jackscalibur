### Hi There! ✋

I’m a Product Security Engineer at Toyota, specializing in security testing across multiple domains, including Mobile, API, and Cloud security.

I'm passionate about the convergence of software engineering and security.

Right now, I'm spending a lot of time learning **Rust**. It's pretty cool.
