# About Me

My name is Jackson, and I work for Toyota as a **Product Security Engineer**. I work to secure the vehicle and mobile application-facing services and APIs.

I perform security audits for both Android and iOS apps, use Burp Suite for REST, gRPC and GraphQL API security testing, use Wireshark for Layer 2-7 analysis, write my own security tools using Python and Rust, etc.

---

Hollistically, I'm interested in the intersection between cyber security and software engineeringâ€”that is, I enjoy both writing and securing software.

I enjoy using Python and Rust the most, but I am also comfortable with languages such as Golang and Java. I consider myself a generalist for now, and enjoy learning more about Network (Layers 4 and 7 the most) and Linux security in my spare time.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Rust, Golang, Python, Java
