## About Me
I am a product security engineer for Toyota who performs security assessments against the Toyota and Lexus mobile applications, all vehicle-related APIs and vehicle-related AWS environments.

I am also involved with performing security testing against several vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) at the OS level (Linux).

I like to program during my free time. Lately, I have been using Rust a lot in my projects.
